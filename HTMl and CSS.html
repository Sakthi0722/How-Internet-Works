    <hr>
    <h3 class="text-left">World Wide Web Consortium(W3C):</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. As of 21 October 2019, W3C had 443 members.[3][2] W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for discussion about the Web.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet. It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with CSAIL, to the Stata Centre.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC (KRIS) becoming the Asian host in September 1996. Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-left">Hypertext Markup Language(HTML):</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as "&lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;canvas&gt;, &lt;datalist>, &lt;details&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;output&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;video&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt; and many others.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title&gt; tag can be written as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or in any other way.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behaviour and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
    <h4 class="text-left">Anatomy of an HTML element:</h4>
    <img src= "https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    <p class="text-justify">(Image Credit:https://developer.mozilla.org/)(Above is an example of HTML code)
    <br>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>The main parts of our element are as follows:</b></p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>The opening tag:</b>This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>The closing tag:</b>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>The content:</b>This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>The element:</b>The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</b></p>
    <img src= "https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    <p class="text-justify">(Image Credit:https://developer.mozilla.org/)(Above is an example of Attribute of an Element)
    <br>
    <p class="text-justify">Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>An attribute should always have the following:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
        <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
    </ul>
