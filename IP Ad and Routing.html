    <h1 class="text-center">IP Addresses, Packets and Routing</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="text-left">IP Address:</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>How IP works:</b> IP is designed to work over a dynamic network. This means that IP must work without a central directory or monitor, and that it cannot rely upon specific links or nodes existing. IP is a connectionless protocol that is datagram-oriented., so each packet must contain the source IP address, destination IP address, and other data in the header to be successfully delivered.Combined, these factors make IP an unreliable, best effort delivery protocol. Error correction is handled by upper level protocols instead. These protocols include TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol, and UDP, which is a connectionless protocol. Most internet traffic is TCP/IP.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>IP versions:</b> There are two versions of IP in use today, IPv4 and IPv6. The original IPv4 protocol is still used today on both the internet, and many corporate networks. However, the IPv4 protocol only allowed for 232 addresses. This, coupled with how addresses were allocated, led to a situation where there would not be enough unique addresses for all devices connected to the internet.IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and was formalized in 1998. This upgrade substantially increased the available address space and allowed for 2128 addresses. In addition, there were changes to improve the efficiency of IP packet headers, as well as improvements to routing and security.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>IPv4 addresses:</b> IPv4 addresses are actually 32-bit binary numbers, consisting of the two sub addresses (identifiers) mentioned above which, respectively, identify the network and the host to the network, with an imaginary boundary separating the two. An IP address is, as such, generally shown as 4 octets of numbers from 0-255 represented in decimal form instead of binary form.</p>
    <h4 class="text-left">Example:</h4>
    <h6 class="text-center">For example, the address 168.212.226.204 represents the 32-bit binary number 10101000.11010100.11100010.11001100. in IPv4.</h6>
    <p class="text-justify">The binary number is important because that will determine which class of network the IP address belongs to.IPv4 addresses are composed of two parts. The first numbers in the address specify the network, while the latter numbers specify the specific host. A subnet mask specifies which part of an address is the network part, and which part addresses the specific host.A packet with a destination address that is not on the same network as the source address will be forwarded, or routed, to the appropriate network. Once on the correct network, the host part of the address determines which interface the packet gets delivered to.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>IPv6 addresses:</b> To avoid the seemingly reoccurring issue in technology, where a specification’s limitation seems more than sufficient at the time, but inevitably becomes too small, the designers of IPv6 created an enormous address space for IPv6. The address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits in IPv6.The IPv6 has a theoretical limit of 3.4 x 1038 addresses. That’s over 340 undecillion addresses, which is reportedly enough addresses to assign one to every single atom on the surface of the earth.IPv6 addresses are represented by eight sets of four hexadecimal digits, and each set of numbers is separated by a colon.</p>
    <h4 class="text-left">Example:</h4>
    <h6 class="text-center">An example IPv6 address would look like this: 2DAB:FFFF:0000:3EAE:01AA:00FF:DD72:2C4A</h6>
    <p class="text-justify">With IPv6 addresses being so long, there are conventions to allow for their abbreviation. First, leading zeros from any one group of numbers may be eliminated. For example, :0033: can be written as :33:Second, any consecutive sections of zeros can be represented by a double colon. This may be done only once in any address. The number of sections removed using this abbreviation can be determined as the number required to bring the address back up to eight sections.Like in IPv4 certain address blocks are reserved for private networks. These addresses are not routed over the public internet. In IPv6, private addresses are called Unique Local Addresses (ULA). Addresses from the FC00:: /7 block are ignored and not routed by default.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"><b>Name resolution:</b>
    <p class="text-justify">In both IPv4 and IPv6, remembering the IP address of every device is not possible, except on the smallest of networks. Name resolution provides a way to lookup an IP address from an easier to use name.On the internet, name resolution is handled by the Domain Name System (DNS). With DNS, a name in the format host. Domain can be used in place of the destination’s IP address. When the connection is initiated, the source host will request the IP address of the destination host from a DNS server. The DNS server will reply with the destination’s IP address. This IP address will then be used for all communications sent to that name.</p>
